  - text: Finally, the Mandarin manages to figure out the code to open the chest. As he pries back the lid, a bright purple glow fills the room. The Mandarin stands back and pulls out a mechanical extraction claw before reaching into the case with it and pulling out a glowing purple stone. You spy a small case in his other hand, obviously to contain the stone. Do you wait for him to put it in, then jump him as he comes out, or attack him now?
    options:

      - text: Wait
        death: The Mandarin fits the stone into the case, then turns to exit. As he comes out of the door, you pull your gun and tell him to surrender. In a flash, he flips out of the way and chucks a grenade at you. You die in the explosion. 

      - text: Attack Now
